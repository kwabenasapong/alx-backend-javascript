/* In a file named 5-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module:

It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
HTTP server should listen on port 1245
It should return plain text
When the URL path is /, it should display Hello Holberton School! in the page body
When the URL path is /students, it should display This is the list of our students
followed by the same content as the file 3-read_file_async.js (with and without the database)
- the name of the database must be passed as argument of the file
CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student! */
